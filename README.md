### Security Configuration Overview
```
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"          # Frontend dependencies
    directory: "/"
    schedule: {interval: "weekly"}
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"          # Backend dependencies

## Critical Security Fix: Tasks Endpoint Protection

### Problem Identified
The `/tasks` endpoint had a security vulnerability where unauthorized requests could potentially access task data.

### Security Fix Implementation
**Dual-Layer Protection:**

#### Frontend Security Layer
```
// Token validation before API calls
if (!TokenManager.isValid()) {
    console.log('No valid token - preventing unauthorized API calls');
    renderTasks([]);
    updateStats([]);
    return;
}
```

#### Backend Security Layer  
```
// Security-fixed /tasks endpoint
const handleGetTasks = async function (req, res) {
    if (!databaseAvailable) {
        tasks = [/* Demo tasks */];
    } else if (req.user) {
        // Authenticated user - load only their tasks
        tasks = await Database.getAllTasksForUser(req.user.id);
    } else {
        // SECURITY-FIX: Empty array for unauthorized requests
        tasks = [];
        console.log('Unauthorized request - returning empty array');
    }
    res.json(tasks);
};
```

### Security Status
- **Frontend Protection**: No unauthorized API calls
- **Backend Protection**: Empty array for unauthorized requests  
- **Data Isolation**: Zero data leak possible
